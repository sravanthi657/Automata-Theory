# Automata-Theory
Assignments done as part of Automata Theory course at IIITH

* ### 50 Questions
    - We were asked to list 50 questions  from this course topics involves:

        - DFAs and their design, Closure properties for regular languages, NFA design, Regular expressions to NFAs, NFAs to DFAs, and Pumping Lemma, Non-Regularity of Languages.
        -  Minimization of DFAs, Context free Languages, Grammars, Designing CFGs, Type 0,1,2,3 Grammars, Pushdown Automata (PDA), Ambiguity in parsing, Inherently ambiguous languages, and equivalence of PDAs and CFGs

* ### Programming assignment
